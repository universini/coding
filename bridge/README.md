Build and run instructions:
===========================

This folder has two approaches in two separate folders such as solution_1 & solution_2. Both solutions have different logic in chosing hikers from one side to another.

In order to build either entire coding repository can be cloned that has all my other programs as well. Else bridge folder only can be downloaded and build files as follows:

From main folder, rum "make", it will build "bridge" binay

Then "./bridge" will displays the results

And, "make clean" to clean up obj and executable files
